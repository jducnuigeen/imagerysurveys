Introduction
=============================

Purpose
-----------------------------

This document provides detailed metadata (data dictionary) for the NZ Imagery Surveys data published on the LINZ Data Service (LDS).

Background
----------------------------

Over the next decade, the LINZ Topographic Office is working towards its vision of recognising the way location information can help unlock new patterns and knowledge, particularly when it is combined with other types of information. One of our strategic goals is to improve national scale datasets and maximize their opportunities for reuse by a variety of national and regional stakeholders.

Orthoimagery for the country available on the LDS is a result of many different aerial flights spanning many different regions, flown over multiple years, and at different resolutions. As a result, each set of orthoimagery has an index tile dataset which contains metadata specfic for that dataset. The NZ Imagery Surveys data described here provides a single source for all currently available orthoimagery index tiles availabe on the LDS.


Description
---------------------------

The NZ Imagery Surveys dataset contains a comprehensive index of all orthophoto index tiles found on the LDS. Each record in the dataset provides both a geometry of the maximum extent of the orthophoto index, as well as all attributes found in each index tile. This dataset therefore provides information to assess orthophoto coverage and metadata across the entire country.


File format
---------------------------

The dataset consists of vector polygons in NZTM projection.
